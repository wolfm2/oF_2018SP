In my code, I use NASA Neo(Near Earh ) API try to visualize the data of the Neo asteroids pass through earth every day.

I featured the background with the night photo of Manhattan which is 2.1 km. I try to visualize the size of the asteroid compare to the real size of the city to give users a direct impression of how big the asteroid is. No matter we realize it or not, there are millions of asteroids pass by earth everyday. I think it's important to visualize the phenomenon to the audience. 


I use "keyPressed()" to change date to get the asteroids' information provides by NASA API. On the screen will show the "id" & 
the date of the day it passes. It will also show the audience how many asteroids in total pass by earth today. 

I used ofNoise() to make the asteroid moves and rotate kind of mimic the way it flies in the outter space. It will scale a little bit and slightly rotate during its way moving forward. 

I also add sound into the program. It's the sound from outter space which features the animation of the asteroid. 


Technical:
1. JSON addon
2. openframework
3. NASA Api



Further Iteration:
1. Make the movements more smoothy than now using the ofNoise()
