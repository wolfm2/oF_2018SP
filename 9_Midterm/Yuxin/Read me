Fireflies play

For my midterm project, I was inspired by fireflies. I myself have never seen lots of fireflies at the same time in the city,
and I always feel that urban people lack such a chance to interact with fireflies.
Hence, Iâ€™m trying use particle systems, leap motion as well as weather Api in the openFramework to create an scene where users 
could interact with fireflies by their hands.

Technical part
1. leapmotion addon
2. openframework
3. Dark Sky Api


The requirement I fulfilled
Api
Sound
Movement
Easing
FBO
Drawing 
Fonts & Writing 
An ofxAddon not covered in class  (leapmotion)
A Web API
Interaction
A presentation

Further steps:
1. add sounds for the night
2. think in a large scale
