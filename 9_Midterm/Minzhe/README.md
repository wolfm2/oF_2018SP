# Human Microbiome
In this project, I am developing a wearable tech in the domain of data visualization that helps users have a better understanding of their health condition, which can also assist medical diagnosis.

## Technical part
I used the adafruit circuit playground to connect OF with serial port.
The three sensors I used to visualize the data is light, sound and temperature sensor. All of them are analog output.

## The requirement I fulfilled
