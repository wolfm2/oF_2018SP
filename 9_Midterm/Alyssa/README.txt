Questions/Comments:

Of course they updated the data set the morning of midterm due date and thus the weirdness in class. See video documentation for how it was coded prior to update. Looks like when they pushed the update, all the JSON path numbering changed. I went in and tried to fix all the reference points, but coloring still looks slightly wonky. 

Also not sure why the plink sound only plays once your mouse leave the designated area. I tried to code it so the sound would play when mousing over the designated area.
