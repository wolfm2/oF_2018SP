Concept:
Getting the inspiration from the penguin pile up game and the floating iceberg, I started to think about the process of iceberg melting and want to focus on encironmental problem and global warming.  
Thus I am wondering:
# Whether I can use floating iceberg to stress the gloal warming issues?  
# Rather than seriously criticizing the environmental problem, how can I make it an educational interactive piece to concern people?
# Instead of simply blaming the companies which create global warming gases, is it possible to affect people's daily behavior and recall people's attention to relfect on their actions? 
# How to give people a feeling of their environment is unstable and fragile and is being affected by human all the time? 



Process:
1. Draw illustrations of the floating island, coal and gas company, grass, smoke and the sea weaves in  Adobe AI and load in OF.
2. Getting use of the Carbon Intensity API (http://carbonintensity.org.uk/) from the U.K. government. 
	#The carbon intensity data is updated every half hour and to make it  in a real-time trend I fetch the data from 2018-Jan-01-00:00 till now and codinng it to change every 5 seconds to make it change faster. 
	#During the data fetching process I firstly use for loops in for loops in update() function to get data from minute, hour, day to month. But it shows out that nothing is showing up on the screen. I finally relized that the problem is that I run too much code in one frame that it doesn't have enough time to draw things. So I tried and changed another logic which basically creating different counts for minute, hour, day and month.
 	#Without any data earlier that 2017-10-26, I cannot creat a big trend of how carbon dioxide is increasing in the air
	#The higher the sealevel, the worse global warming
3. I use map to map the carbon intensity to island's height and the radius of smoke circle to make them changing along with data online.
4. For the interation part, I create a scenerio that whenever people click on the screen:
# the program will trigger the sound of water floating;
# the sealevel will decrease;
# there will grows up a plant on the island;
# the radius of the smoke of the electricity supply company will decrease; 
# the smoke will ease in towards the opposite position of the mouse.
