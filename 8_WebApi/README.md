## Make a new project using the addon ofxJSON: 

	Write "Hello World" on the canvas.  (Once successful, this can be removed.)
	
	Using our Web API:
	
	Draw the summary text and high temperature for tomorrow on the canvas.
    
	Use key presses 0-7 to print the above for each day in the forecast. 
	Draw an orange circle on the screen at y=100 r=50.
    
	Its X should be a map() using our current time, sunrise/sunset, and the width of the canvas.

	Use this with the current time, sunrise, sunset to map a value between 0 - 1.
    
	Using the above number, make the background a lerp between yellow (255,255,0) and black.
