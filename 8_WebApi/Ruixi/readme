What I do,

1.Write "Hello World” once at the beginning. And move the text out of screen.
2.Using our DarkSky API, and Draw the summary text and high temperature for tomorrow.
3. Use key presses 0-7 to show the different information data from day 1 - day 8
4.Draw an sun (A circle and use  ofSetCircleResolution  function made the circle looks more round 
on the canvas.
5. Its X should be a map() using our current time, sunrise/sunset, and the width of the canvas.

6.mix the background lerp between yellow and black and map the value between 0-1 
 (Data from current time API, sunrise, sunset)
 


Challenge:
1.the X location of the sun does not exit.
2.spent a lot of time on how to lerp background color. 
Cause, I draw the background color and the put the lerp function into “setup”. It should work in the "draw".
