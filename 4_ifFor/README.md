## Modifying the If For example:

	ifForExample only tests the x distance.  Add code so that it also tests the y distance.  
	I.E. Limits the "fill" effect to a box around the current mouse position.

	Intermediate:
  		Change ifForExample so circles change only if both the mouse x and y values are 
  		within range of the circle being drawn!  I.E. Limits the "fill" effect to a 
  		circle around the current mouse position.

	Advanced:
  		Apply the fbo trails technique on ifForExample
