Translation/Overview: 

I aimed to create a surreal neighborhood view for users to explore. It's navigationally useless, but its vibrancy lends a textural sense of place. To do this, I used a generative 3D mesh over one of my Surreal Street View photos of Chinatown, so users can navigate the space like they would on Google Maps. Feet and eyes follow the cursor, with the eyes leaving a trail that weaves in and out of the landscape. These features emphasize the importance of really sensing and experiencing the city in-person, walking and looking around, as opposed to the vantage point of a Google car with 16 algorithmic lenses. 

There's also a city soundscape the reacts to mouse movement, getting louder with drag and release as the user interacts with and immerses themselves in the environment.

Comments:

Sorry for weird sound in my presentation video. I needed to edit out the part where my cat decided to knock stuff off my desk.
