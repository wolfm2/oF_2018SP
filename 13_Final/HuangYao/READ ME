Since I noticed one of my friend in high school, he was suffered by cyberbullying, he didn't tell his parents, he was rejected to go to school because he was so depressed and sad. Students in our school were make fun of him that lead him tried to suicide.  After the semester, he was transferred to another school. 
This case makes me to think about how cyberbullying hurts a person. Especially a teenager.  Also since internet has spread around the world. Teenagers start to use phone, laptop earlier that means teenagers reach out to the online world earlier. Internet provides many platforms like FB, instagram, twitter for us to set up our own page and share lives. However, thing has two faces, people faced a challenge, which is cyberbullying. 
Cyberbullying has the potential to cause intense harm to others because it can happen anytime, be carried around with a person anywhere, and spread quickly in ways that can never be undone.  Many cyber bullies think that bullying others online is funny. These bullies may not realize the consequences for themselves of cyberbullying. 
With the variety of social media apps and networks, it can be difficult to keep up with the trends. I have laid out current statistics and facts in regards to cyberbullying to highlight areas of concern for parents when it comes to protecting their children. 
This projectâ€™s main goal is to give people a whole one time experience that can give them an alert or a reminder to stop, pay more attention on these behaviors and teens.  This interactive installation can let people feel like they are the victims, to experience the feelings.
