For this project I tried to convey the changing relationship between our cat and recently adopted puppy.

Simple shapes represent the cat and dog in the animation. The bodies are drawn with circles, while the 
ears were added in using triangles which were translated and rotated around the x-y coordinates of the 
body to give a sense of direction.

The dog is controlled via the mouse, and faces towards the mouse movement. The cat moves in a circle, 
with the radius offset using perlin noise to give it an organic feeling, instead of moving in a straight 
circle.

When the dog gets close to the cat and passes a threshold radius, the cat "hisses", moving the origin 
of its movement circle in the opposite direction. It also turns red and increases in size to show its 
anger. All of these responses use easing functions to give them a smoother feel.

While creating the project I ran in to two major problems. The first is that my object oriented skills 
are a little rusty, and I ended up not planning things out well and overloading most of my inherited 
functions.

The second issue I ran in to was in regards to some vector math. The ofPoint object in 
openframeworks is used to store point coordinates, but it's just a typedef for the ofVec3f class. 
This means that all the functions that apply to ofPoint are just vector math functions. For example, 
if your mouse moves from ofPoint(1, 0) to ofPoint(0, 1), the angle between the two vectors is 90 
degrees. If you want to treat them as points however, your angle difference would be calculated 
using atan2(yDiff, xDiff), giving you 135 degrees as a heading. I spent a bunch of time using 
the angle() method of ofPoint/ofVec3f trying to determine heading, when I should have been using 
atan2().
