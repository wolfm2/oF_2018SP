Concept: It's vital to stay different from your surroundings no matter where you are.

Inspiration: I got my inspiration from the famous geometry painting by Mondrian.

Coding:
from line 32-59, I used ofDrawRectangle and ofSetcolor to draw the Mondrian Painting.
from line 62-111, I used if() to change the color of the circle according to its position.
from line 15-17, 23 & line 68-75, I TRIED to use the Matrix() to rotate the circle but I failed.

Issue:
Basically, I declared rX, rY and rZ in line 15-17, and update them in line 23-25.
From line 68-75, I tried to draw the circle ofDrawCircle() in the ofMatrix() but it doesn't work.
I wonder whether I could directly draw a circle in the ofMatrix().
Thanks!
