# HSIllusion
This project is inspired by a biodesign project Microbial Home.  You have a bee house at home. On the one side, you can observe the structure and see busy bees. On the other side, it's outdoor and bees can work on their own.

My narrative is pretty simple. You can use different keys to rotate, translate bees, so they make honey. You can use the mouse to extract honey and make honey lollypop.

I used if function on line 36-50 to decide whether a certain key is pressed and released so that I can update the rotation value.

I used ease-out on line 51, 52. framebuffer on line 58-69. I was trying to play around with the colour for fbo filter on line 68.

I used Matrix on line 73-108, but have some problems with one image.

I used keyPressed, keyReleased, mouseMoved and loaded image and sound.

I changed the sound speed to make a certain sound effect at different pitches on line 39.
