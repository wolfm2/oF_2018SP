first of all I appologize for not presenting,
in this project I wanted to create a personal gallery that tells different stories,
starting with minimal screen that convey the concept, and then you can move between the images.

Inicial idea was creating a stop motion video with the analog filmmaking effect, I thought using ofb would do that. 
so I took pictures to create a mini flim that you can control it's speed by moving the mouse up and down.
I still want to do this project sometime.

the sound is not playing because of the heaviness of the matrix - I guess-, although I tried to trim it to make it lighter but still.
