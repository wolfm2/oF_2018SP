concept:
When seeing a stack of rectangles which can change their directions while mouse if moving, I get the idea that in other perspectives, rectangle could also be the part of line. So I start the narrative of how a happy single line lose itself and refind itself. The story begins with a happy day. The line is excitedly jumping along the road and suddenly he found a rectangle crew. As it was curious about what was going on, an rectangle jump across and communicate with the crew and finally join. So clever the line was that it started to imitate and try to talke to the crew. However, they didn't accept it at all. The line became so angry. At this time, the sun comes out. The sunshine cast the line's shadow on the ground and the shape is surprisingly a rectangle. (turning around and showing rectangle to screen which means the shadow right now turn to be a line)Discovering that, line didn't feel sad anymore, turned it's line side to screen and insisted on being itself and jumped away.
steps:
1.use frame numbers and if-else to devide the linear structure of the story
2.use sin() function to draw the jumping activity
