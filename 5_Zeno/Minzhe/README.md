The code related is line 36, 37.

I was tring to use the trigonometric function logic to create a positive correlation between speed and distance, so I can increase the speed of the triangle toward my mouse. I only get it this far. I can increase the speed by using the change of the distance, but I can't make it move toward the mouse.
