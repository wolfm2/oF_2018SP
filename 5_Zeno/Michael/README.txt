Translation/Overview: (Omit if not needed. What do I need to know to interact with your program?)

There was no translation work needed.
Move the mouse around the canvas to make the square follow.  
There are no key events in this program.


Attribution: (Omit if not needed)

None.  All submitted code was written by me.


Requirements: 

Change the type of easing from ease-out to ease-in. 
Hint: Make a new variable == your max speed
Add sound when the square gets within 100px of your mouse.

1) ofApp.cpp:49 and ofApp.cpp:67
2) ofApp.cpp:31 
3) Not done.  (If the work was attempted but not working, write "Not working" give a file:line#)


Extra Work:

I solved the problem in two different ways.
ofApp.cpp:49 and ofApp.cpp:67
I wrote code to deal with the jitter in ease-in.
ofApp.cpp:74


Questions/Comments:

I didn't know which way was better so I solved the problem using ifs and a second time with the c++ terniary operator.  Which is better and why?

I have my notes for ofSetVerticalSync(true) and I have read the online documentation.  I am still having problems understanding it.  Can you explain why/when it is useful?
