I inherited Hsuan's Midterm Project. 

The main concept is to visualize the tide status in New York. 

- Analysis for previous one:
  * Backdraws:
  (1) The curve drawing of the wave which was tried to show the high/low of tides,  is not intuitive and obivious to audience;
  (2) The fishing stuff is not relevant to the concept and data, which could be quite confusing and needless;
  (3) The change of background which was to indicate different time is not a successful choice. With no visual appealing aesthetic
      and not engaging enough. 
  
  * Merits：
 （1）I love the GUI part which showed on the screen as a scroll bar to change the date and time for tide information. 
     This is quite intuitive and easy to operate for users instead of keypressed. 
  (2) I like the fish on the canvas. Even though I didn't get the fishing idea in this project but the fish actually is adding some
     vividness into the project. It makes the project and visual effect much more fun and engaging. So I like it a lot!
  
 
 
- Improvements I did:

  (1)Changed the background into more interesting images, which intuitively showed different time period of the day and well-matched
     the main visual style of the sketch;
  (2)Changed the wave into a more intuitive and vivid version. With the information of high/low in different day and time, the wave
     visually showed the difference on the screen which could give audience an immediate impression and understanding of the impact
     that tides caused to our Earth. 
  (3)Delete the fishing cod. Which makes no sense in this project.
