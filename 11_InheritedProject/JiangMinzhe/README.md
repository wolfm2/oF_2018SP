# InheritedProject

## Design Concept
This project is about greenhouse gas's influence on the climate change. I explore more deeply into this concept and recreate the interface to enhance the global warming effect and pollution by carbon dioxide. It not only influence our air quality, but also influence our eco-system.


## The parts I changed
* shader code ofApp.cpp 195-198
* fish class agent.cpp, agent.hpp
* fish color change according to pollution ofApp.cpp 303-305
* air color change according to pollution ofApp.cpp 188-193
* ocean color change according to pollution ofApp.cpp:204-209
* correct the color of the grass and make it a continuous interaction, so user can grow grass continously  ofApp.cpp:272-285
