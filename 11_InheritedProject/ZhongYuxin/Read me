For this inherited project, I tried to make the game initially made by Yuemei more fun and challenging.
Therefore, I made those mushrooms move! Specifically, 

1. used array mSpeed[5] to store different speeds for each mushroom;
2. used Perlin Noise to make speeds more random; 66-70
3. when users get more carrots, mushrooms will move quicker; 162-184
4. when mushrooms get to the boundaries of the canvas, they would automatically reverse the heading direction. 162-184


Issues:
1. Sometimes the game would be just over in the beginning because the locaitons of the frog and mushrooms are so random 
that they may get so close with each other at the very start. I did have trouble in figureing out how to avoid that so far.
2. I wrote the Perlin Noise in the Setup() to get relatively random speeds but I failed to use it in the Draw() to get 
mushrooms move smoothly.
