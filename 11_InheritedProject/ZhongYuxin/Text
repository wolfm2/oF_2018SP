For this inherited project, I tried to make it more fun and exciting for users who are mainly childrens from 8-12. I
1. used array mSpeed[5] to store different speeds for each mushroom;
2. used Perlin Noise to make speeds more random;
3. when users get more carrots, mushrooms will move quicker;
4. when mushrooms get to the boundaries of the canvas, they would automatically reverse the heading direction.
